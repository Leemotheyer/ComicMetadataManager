# Configuration Fix for Comic Metadata Manager

## Problem
When the app was first loaded, it correctly created a blank template config file, but the app then didn't launch properly and users couldn't input the config from the GUI. The issue was that the app tried to initialize the VolumeManager immediately on startup, which failed when the API keys were empty placeholders.

## Solution
The following changes were made to fix the configuration issue:

### 1. Modified VolumeManager Initialization (`app.py`)
- Added a `is_configured()` method that checks if API keys are set and not placeholder values
- Modified the initialization to only check for new volumes if the app is properly configured
- Added proper validation to distinguish between placeholder values and actual configuration

### 2. Updated Main Page (`templates/index.html`)
- Added a configuration warning banner that appears when the app is not properly configured
- The banner includes a direct link to the Settings page
- Passes configuration status to JavaScript

### 3. Enhanced JavaScript Logic (`static/js/app.js`)
- Modified the page initialization to not automatically load volumes when not configured
- Added additional validation in the `loadVolumes()` function
- Shows helpful messages directing users to the Settings page
- Displays a configuration message in the volumes container when not configured

### 4. Updated API Endpoints (`app.py`)
- Modified the `/api/volumes` endpoint to check configuration before processing requests
- Returns helpful error messages when the app is not configured

### 5. Improved Settings Page (`static/js/settings.js`)
- Added automatic redirect to the main page after successful first-time configuration
- Enhanced user experience for new users

## Configuration Validation
The app now properly validates configuration by checking:
- API keys are not empty
- API keys are not placeholder values (`your-kapowarr-api-key-here`)
- Base URL is not placeholder values (`http://your-kapowarr-server:port`)

## User Experience
1. **Fresh Installation**: App shows configuration warning and directs users to Settings
2. **Configuration**: Users can easily access Settings via navigation or warning banner
3. **First-time Setup**: After saving valid configuration, users are redirected to main page
4. **Normal Operation**: Once configured, the app works as expected

## Files Modified
- `app.py` - VolumeManager class and API endpoints
- `templates/index.html` - Added configuration warning
- `static/js/app.js` - Enhanced initialization and validation
- `static/js/settings.js` - Added redirect after configuration
- `settings_manager.py` - No changes needed (already handled config creation properly)

The fix ensures that new users can easily configure the app and existing users continue to have a smooth experience.
